# Canned_Lines

I remembered how difficult it was to make something functional in this app using the React framework. Even with some familiarity with React, this project showed me how much I really don't know as far as Javascript ES6 (e.g. array.map() , spread operator, localstorage, currying). I had to spend a lot of time reading and experimenting with these features in JavaScript. Although this is a rather simple or trivial program to make at hindsight, applying the React framework to build an app that dynamically adds new html textareas which stores the data in the browser's local storage actually took some time to figure it out. 
This is one of my favorite program that I made, which I use in my day-to-day work for note taking. I went so far as to deploy it via GitHub Pages here:
